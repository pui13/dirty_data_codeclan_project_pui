# dirty_data_codeclan_project_pui
 
 For the dirty data project, I had to select two tasks, clean the data and answer the analysis questions.
 
 Both tasks have their own folder and follow the same folder structure.
 
 The folders in each task are:
 
 * analysis_and_documentation
 * clean_data
 * data_cleaning_scripts
 * raw_data
